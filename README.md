# Analysis-of-my-Apple-Music-Activity

# Project Description
This is my first personal project which is a part of a Self-Discovery series: a mega-project on which I have been working for several months as a first step towards self-discovery. Dreams, personal values, talents, personality traits may not always seem to matter much in the rush of daily life, but awareness of these characteristics can give you plenty of insights into your inner self. I am a data enthusiast who believes in the value and power of data and how it can be used to learn more about people. As a first step in honing my analytics skills, I wanted to discover and interpret meaningful patterns through my own data. 

Who doesn't like to work with music running in the background processes of our computers? Music delivers that energy necessary for me to work with full productivity. Music has always helped me with improving my performance, simulating curiosity and imagination, and even amplifying certain emotions. In order to integrate my passion for music and enhance my data analytic skills, I decided to dive into my personal music streaming data on Apple Music and try to understand what are the patterns in the way that I use this service. A number of research studies have shown that musical tastes are good predictors of personality traits. We have always seen that people get a little defensive when asked about their music tastes and this reflects how it relates to attitudes and personality. People do define themselves through music and use it as a means to relate to other people. 

Researchers have found that the type of music you listen to may be even connected to how your brain processes information and how you respond to the world around you. Those who enjoy mellow yet emotionally-rich contemporary music like folk, country music are perceived to be empathetic who respond to the world based on social cues and are often drawn to creative careers. On the other hand, those who enjoy complex, intense, and energetic music are perceived to be systematic, who interact based upon preset conceptions of how people think they should respond. This project would help me explore how my personality can be reflected in my song choices and if I should consider listening to certain styles of music which I normally don't prefer listening to. I have been lifting weights for the past one year and have been recording my progress through an app named Gymstreak. Music has always helped me push weights more than I physically can, so I was curious to know if the type of music I listened to had a correlation with my progress at the gym.

## Data Extraction:
Thanks to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements which were established in 2018, users have the right to access their personal data which includes information like basic identity information, webdata like location, IP addresses, cookie data. You can now request an electronic copy of your personal data, free of charge, upon request and can even inquire about how your data is used, stored, processed or transferred to other organizations. Every year, Spotify releases 'Spotify Wrapped' which is a feature completely driven by data collected by the Spotify platform to curate the 'perfect playlist'. However, Apple Music doesn't have this feature  and I have been a loyal Apple Music user since 2021. When I found out that I could request an archive with all my usage data since 2021, I requested a copy of my data following the required steps:

1. Head to Apple’s Data and Privacy log in page
2. Log in with the Apple ID for which you’d like to download data
3. Under Get a copy of your data, click Get Started

4. Select the data you’d like, 'App Store, Itunes Store, Apple Books and Apple Music'
