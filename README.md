# Analysis-of-my-Apple-Music-Activity

# Project Description
This is my first personal project which is a part of a Self-Discovery series: a mega-project on which I have been working for several months as a first step towards self-discovery. Dreams, personal values, talents, personality traits may not always seem to matter much in the rush of daily life, but awareness of these characteristics can give you plenty of insights into your inner self. I am a data enthusiast who believes in the value and power of data and how it can be used to learn more about people. As a first step in honing my analytics skills, I wanted to discover and interpret meaningful patterns through my own data. 

Who doesn't like to work with music running in the background processes of our computers? Music delivers that energy necessary for me to work with full productivity. Music has always helped me with improving my performance, simulating curiosity and imagination, and even amplifying certain emotions. In order to integrate my passion for music and enhance my data analytic skills, I decided to dive into my personal music streaming data on Apple Music and try to understand what are the patterns in the way that I use this service. A number of research studies have shown that musical tastes are good predictors of personality traits. We have always seen that people get a little defensive when asked about their music tastes and this reflects how it relates to attitudes and personality. People do define themselves through music and use it as a means to relate to other people. 

Researchers have found that the type of music you listen to may be even connected to how your brain processes information and how you respond to the world around you. Those who enjoy mellow yet emotionally-rich contemporary music like folk, country music are perceived to be empathetic who respond to the world based on social cues and are often drawn to creative careers. On the other hand, those who enjoy complex, intense, and energetic music are perceived to be systematic who interact based upon preset conceptions of how people think they should respond. This project would help me exploring how my personality can be reflected in my song choices and if I should consider listening to certain styles of music which I normally don't prefer listening to.
